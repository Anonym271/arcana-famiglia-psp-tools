# arcana-famiglia-psp-tools
Highly experimental, extremely buggy and inperformant explorer and archive extractor for the PSP version of Arcana Famiglia. Sadly the archives often seem to contain little to no file names, so most of the files are just named by index.

File Formats I have discovered and implemented so far:
 - AFS (PlayStation archive file)
 - HFU2 (Arcana Famiglia Archive)
 - UFFA (Just the LZSS compression header, not really a file format)
 - TTH (Image Archive / Collection)

File Formats I have seen but not implemented yet:
 - ANM (Probably animation files)
 - All kinds of scripts (Starting with sth. like "IKA SEQ SYSTEM")
 - Sound files (Don't have a header / file signature)
